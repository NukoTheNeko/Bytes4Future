                What's in Tony's Special? Who cares! It tastes slightly above average and if that's good enough for your 3am drunkard then it's good enough for you.

                We put a moderate amount (none) of love into making this pizza and we are sure you'll find it to be up to your standards (if you've never eaten pizza before).

                It may or may not be boneless, we're not sure.
